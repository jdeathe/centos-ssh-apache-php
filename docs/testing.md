# Testing

## Functional

The functional test cases are written in [shpec](https://github.com/rylnd/shpec). 

To run the tests use the `test` Makefile target after building.

> *Note:* You might need to run via sudo if your environment requires root privileges to run docker.

```
$ make build test
```
